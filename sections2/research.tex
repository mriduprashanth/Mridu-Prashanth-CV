\subsection{{Machine Learning Research @ IDEAS LAB Purdue}\hfill Jun 2023 - Ongoing}
\subtext{Under Professor Aniket Bera and Mr Hrishikesh Viswanath}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Built a visualization tool for a machine learning architecture that predicts the emotion in a given audio clip
\item Used t-SNE to plot clustered (VQ quantized) and unclustered embeddings labeled by predicted emotion
\item Wrote part of the research paper (submitted to AAAI 2024)
\item Bigger goal: to build an emotionally adept chatbot; currently working on 3d emotion editing of faces
\end{zitemize}

\subtext{Lumiere Research Scholars Program, Mentor: Mr. Aaditya Kharel (Purdue Univ.)}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Composed literary review of state of the art (primarily by Gatys et al.) techniques of art generation using ML
\item Analysed the role of filters and layers in both parts of art generation: content extraction and style extraction
\item Performed experimentation using various photos \& painting styles to reinforce strengths \& flaws of neural style transfer
\item Made suggestions for future GAN models that can improve on these flaws
\end{zitemize}
